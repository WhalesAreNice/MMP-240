                <h2>Part I: Mobile Website Analysis</h2>
                <p>1. Chart Art Fair</p>

                <p>2. There is a logo of a "C" inside a 2x2 grid at the top left hand corner of the screen. I don't think the site itself needs a logo, but it is always nice to have one to show the audience what site they are viewing and it looks more professional.</p>
                
                <p>3. The Navigation can be a bit confusing at first because the Menu is an icon at the top with an "=" sign and at first glance people may not know that is the button to pull up the menu. But other than that it is very easy to navigate from page to page. They have a search function as well so you can just look for exactly what you want to see. Each page leads to another and you can go back to the home page by clicking their logo at the top left side of the screen.</p>

                <p>4. The content is delivered with a full size picture slideshow that you can drag between that spans from left to right and below it is text describing the pictures.</p>

                <p>5. I don't like the amount of space between the picture slideshow and the description though, because the spacing is almost as big as the slideshow itself. I would minimize the spacing between the discription and the slideshow because on a mobile device there will be half of your screen as white space in between the scroll. I would maybe do at most half of the spacing that they did. Other than that, I believe their format is really easy to understand and the interactivity it adds to the site is very good in keeping the viewer interested.</p>

                <p>6. The color of the site is mainly black and white, with little splashes of color in the picture slideshows. I always liked black and white because it is easy on the eyes and clear to read. When text goes to colors besides black and white, they can interfer with each other and become hard to read.</p>

                <p>7. The font is a san-serif and the sizing is pretty good, maybe a bit small for mobile devices. But besides the sizing of the text I think everything else is perfectly fine, the spacing is nice and the headings are bold, which makes them pop out more and catch the eyes of the viewer.</p>

                <p>8. There are images, it is displayed as a slideshow and they take up the whole span of the screen from left to right. It fits perfectly onto the screen, but I would prefer if there was some padding to the sides because it is literally hugging the sides of your phone's screen, which some people may like, but I prefer it to not touch because in my mind, if it is touching the side of my screen there can be parts of the image that I am missing and I will naturally try to drag the photo to a side to see if there actually is more to it. The photos are the main content of the site and the text supports the images.</p>

                <p>9. There isn't advertising on the site, besides advertising it's own Art Fair's location, time, etc.</p>

                <p>10. I like the transitions that the slideshows have, it fades into the back, while bringing forward the next image. There is a search option at the top right hand side of the screen, which I like as well because there are soemtimes things you want to search for that may be on the site, but not on the front page and without having to go through all the trouble of finding it manually, you just do a quick search and it brings up everything relavant to what you typed in. I noticed on their pages that they have a small fading gradient on the right hand side, where they tried to do something fancy, but I think it isn't needed because sometimes it makes the text harder to read and overall, just unnessesary.</p>

                <h2>Part II: My Questions</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Will all the information that we need be given to us? So we are just designing the layout of the site and how it looks rather than adding content?</li>
                        <li>Are we able to put multiple artists' bios on the same page if they are very similar? Or do we have to stick to one page for each artist?</li>
                        <li>What are the biggest dimensions we will scale for and the smallest? </li>
                        <li>Will there be any Javascript requirements in the site to make it more interactive?</li>
                        <li>If we are given the content to put into the site, do we have to use everything or can we pick and choose?</li>
                    </ol>

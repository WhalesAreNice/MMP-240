                <div class="first_p">
                    <p>The site that I like the most is Reddit. It is a site that has many subReddits that provide information, News and many other types of content depending on the subReddit that it is. The subReddit that I frequent a lot is (reddit.com/r/overwatch) which is a sub site based on the game Overwatch.</p>

                    <div id="split_1">
                        <p>The site works very well in providing an abundance of fan made content and news about the game. The layout is easy on the eyes, it has good sized titles of each post with a small thumbnail image that can relate to the content within the post. The only complain I have with this format is that the small thumbnail is a bit too small to skim through and you have to actually focus on the image to see it.</p>
                    </div> <!-- end of split_1 -->
                    <div id="split_2">
                        <p>The typography is very simple and easy to read. And because it is easy to read, people can skim through pages of Titles to find the ones that they want to look at. Meanwhile skipping all the things they don't want to see.</p>

                <div class="filter">
                    <p>Reddit also has ways to filter out specific types of posts. On the Overwatch subReddit, the side bar has the options to show and hide (Highlights, eSports, Console, etc) and you can show and hide each one to customize the page layout to your liking. Another way you can change the layout is with a reddit plug in for your browser called Reddit Enhance Suite, which allows you to change the color scheme to a dark background, which I like.</p>
                </div> <!-- end of filter -->
                <div class="filter_img">
                    <img id="filter_img" src="images/filter.png" alt="filter">
                </div> <!-- end of filter_img -->
                <hr>
                <div class="ending">
                    <p>Reddit has people of all ages browsing it and they even have their own Mobile App. It is easy to navigate through the App because when you click on each post, it opens up a small preview of the post and allows you to go into the specific post if you want. I feel like the layout of the site is great, easy to go through and browse. The one qualm I have with it is that it is very dense with content, but that comes with the site because any person can post on Reddit, so the amount of submissions would dictate the amount of posts they have to show.</p>
